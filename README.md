# ImageScrapper
### How to use
Run the program and a url for example : 
ImageScrapper.py url
+This will get all the images of the webpage. 
+Do not write in an image file instead of a url.
+You must provide the http:// or https://
+I only tested this on Reddit and 4chan so it might not work for every site
